## Introduction

The Facial Keypoints Detection project involves using deep learning techniques to predict the coordinates of facial keypoints in images. This README file provides an overview of the project, its goals, and how to use the codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-keypoints-detection.git
   cd facial-keypoints-detection
   ```
### Data Exploration

The project begins with loading the facial keypoints dataset, exploring a sample of the training data, checking for missing values, and visualizing the correlation between features.

### Data Visualization

This section involves extracting and visualizing a sample image from the training data, providing insight into the structure of the image data.

### Facial Keypoints Visualization

Facial keypoints coordinates are extracted and visualized on an image from the training data, showcasing the ground truth annotations.

### Gaussian Heatmaps

Gaussian heatmaps for facial keypoints are generated and visualized. These heatmaps represent the expected distribution of keypoint locations.

### Neural Network Models

Two neural network models are defined for facial keypoints detection: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and LeNet-5. These models are implemented using PyTorch.

### Training and Testing

The CNN model is trained using the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on a validation set. Training and validation errors are plotted over epochs to assess model convergence.

### Model Evaluation and Visualization

Samples with actual and predicted facial keypoints are visualized, providing a qualitative assessment of the model's performance. Additionally, test data is used to showcase the model's predictions on unseen images.
